# Weather-Pollution-Prediction-and-Ozone-level-Detection-System
Machine learning project

Traditionally weather forecasting has been done by physical models. These models arenâ€™t reliable for longer
durations which leads to inaccuracy. Due to nonlinear processes that involve the concentrations of pollutants
and their partially known dynamics, it is difficult to produce a model able to forecast these types of events.
Ozone detection is primarily done by ozone sensors, but the changes in the temperature and humidity can affect
sensor readings also the life span of these sensors is 12-18 months only. A reliable system is to be developed
to predict various weather conditions using Data analysis and Machine learning techniques.

This system predicts the future of weather and pollution for next 12 months and also classifies the a day as ozone
and non-ozone day depending upon the temperature peak, wind speed peak, humidity etc. In our portal the user
can see temperature, humidity, AQI, PM2.5, etc of 12 months and also see the trends followed by the same. It
also has section of Ozone which shows the graph of count of Ozone day and Non-Ozone day.
